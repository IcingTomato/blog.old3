# Buy a Elastic Compute Service (or use a Raspberry Pi) 

This document is made from Linux Environment(Debian). And you will need more than 2048MB RAM. (Raspberry Pi 4GB/8GB is recommanded)

# Installing Java Runtime Environment

```shell
$ sudo apt install openjdk-8-jre-headless openjdk-8-jdk-headless
```

Verify the installation by printing the Java version :

```shell
$ java -version
```

It is not necessary to add a new user account. But if you want to use other account, please use `useradd` command.

# Downloading Minecraft Server

Head over to the [Minecraft download page](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/) to get the download link of the latest Minecraft server’s Java archive file (JAR).

You can use **wget** to download [server.jar](https://launcher.mojang.com/v1/objects/1b557e7b033b583cd9f66746b7a9ab1ec1673ced/server.jar)

```shell
$ mkdir mc
$ cd mc
$ wget https://launcher.mojang.com/v1/objects/1b557e7b033b583cd9f66746b7a9ab1ec1673ced/server.jar
```

# Configuring Minecraft Server

Once the download is completed, navigate to the **~/mc** directory and start the Minecraft server:

```shell
$ cd ~/server
$ java -Xms1024M -Xmx2048M -jar server.jar nogui
```

When started for the first time, the server executes some operations and creates the **server.properties** and **eula.txt** files and stops.

To run the server you’ll need to agree to the Minecraft EULA. Open the **eula.txt** file and change **eula=false** to **eula=true**:

```shell
$ sudo vim ~/mc/eula.txt
```

Close and save the file.

Next, edit the **server.properties** file to enable the rcon protocol and set the rcon password. Open the file using your text editor.

# Creating Systemd Unit File

To run Minecraft as a service, we will create a new Systemd unit file.

Switch back to your sudo user by typing **exit**.

Open your text editor and create a file named **minecraft.service** in the **/etc/systemd/system/**:

```shell
$ sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/minecraft.service
```

Paste the following configuration:

```shell
[Unit]
Description=Start Minecraft
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/root/start_minecraft_server.bash
TimeoutStartSec=0

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

And then:

```shell
$ cd ~
$ sudo vim start_minecraft_server.bash
```

start_minecraft_server.bash

```shell
#!/bin/bash

#Standard Minecraft
cd /root/mc
exec java -jar server.jar nogui
```

Save and close the file and reload the systemd configuration:

```shell
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl start minecraft
$ sudo systemctl status minecraft
$ sudo systemctl enable minecraft
```
